This tutorial will teach you how to build your very first iPhone App! 
By the end of this tutorial you will have created your own enhanced version of the classic *Notes* app that comes with every iOS device.  

Now I'm sure your ready to tackle this challenge after getting a taste of development in the Swift Playground, however before we dive straight into this fully fledged Application, let's
start with something a little smaller to introduce Application building in Xcode.

We are going to take brief tour through the following key areas:

- Welcome to Xcode, your new best friend
- Setting up your first Xcode project
- Introduction to Interface Builder
- What is a Storyboard?
- Using Auto Layout
- Connecting the dots, IBActions & IBOutlets
- Debugging your code

Some of you may be already familiar with some of these areas and that's great. Before you skip ahead, I would always recommend a full read through
as this might be part of the test at the end ;)

Let's get started by meeting your new best friend, Xcode.
