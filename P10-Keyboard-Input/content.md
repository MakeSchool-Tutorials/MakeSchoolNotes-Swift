##Keyboard Handling

In our app, keyboard handling for the most part *just works*. However, the user experience is not optimal.

When you want to add a new note, you would expect the keyboard to auto-activate and set focus to the title field. 
If you are viewing an existing note then you would expect the note to be displayed (with the option to edit) and only present the keyboard when a field is clicked on. 

How does the app know if we want to edit/create or view a new note? Well, it doesn't. You will need to implement this logic.
You can create an `edit` variable that can be set in much the same way as the display note. However, it's a good time to think about design
from a user experience perspective and how we can infer behaviour logic.

For example, if a Note has no title or content, it stands to reason that you would want to edit it by default as an empty note isn't very informative.
Let's add an `edit` variable flag and have it set when a `didSet` is called on our note.

> Open `NoteDisplayViewController`and add a new `edit` boolean variable to this class. Set it to a default value of `false`.

Now modify `func viewWillAppear` as follows:

	override func viewWillAppear(animated: Bool) {
        super.viewWillAppear(animated)
>        
        displayNote(self.note)
>    
        titleTextField.returnKeyType = .Next //1
        titleTextField.delegate = self       //2
>        
    }

Time to set our edit flag status based upon the note content.

##First Responder

> [action]
> Modify `func displayNote` as follows:
>
    func displayNote(note: Note?) {
        if let note = note, titleTextField = titleTextField, contentTextView = contentTextView  {
            titleTextField.text = note.title
            contentTextView.text = note.content
>            
            if count(note.title)==0 && count(note.content)==0 { //1
                titleTextField.becomeFirstResponder()
            }
        }
    }
>    
> - 1 Check the length of our note content strings. If there is no content assume 'Edit' mode and set the first responder. This will set focus to the titleTextField
and prompt the user with the keyboard ready for title input. 
> If we are not in edit mode then the note will be displayed as is and no keyboard will pop up until the user initiates this action for themselves.
 
We still need to add delegate for our textField.

##Adding UITextFieldDelegate
 
> [action]
> Add the following extension code:
> 
    extension NoteDisplayViewController: UITextFieldDelegate {
>    
        func textFieldShouldReturn(textField: UITextField) -> Bool {
>            
            if (textField == titleTextField) {  //1
                contentTextView.becomeFirstResponder()
                contentTextView.returnKeyType = .Done
            }
>            
            return false
        }
    }
>    

1. When the 'Return' button is pressed, or in our case 'Next', this delegate will be called. We need to check that the `textField` in question is our `titleTextField`. If so, then
we want to move the user input onto editing the `contentTextView` leading to a nicer user experience.

Great! We can finally allow the user to manage their note content.

##Hold Up

Hmm... did you see that the bottom toolbar is no longer visible when editing a note? 
The keyboard appears over the top and our toolbar is no longer visible. Well, in this case it doesn't make a great difference to the user experience. However 
it's good to know how you could change this as there will be times when you do want to have this functionality available.

Let's set the scene for some constraint magic.

##Constraint Connection

> [action]
> Add the following variables to your `NoteDisplayViewController`
>
    @IBOutlet weak var deleteButton: UIBarButtonItem!
    @IBOutlet weak var toolbarBottomSpace: NSLayoutConstraint!
>
    var keyboardNotificationHandler: KeyboardNotificationHandler?
>
>
> Connect the `deleteButton` outlet to your trash can button in the toolbar.

Now when the keyboard pops up, we want to move the toolbar to be positioned above the keyboard.  
So the constraint we will want to modify will be the vertical space between the bottom of the view and the toolbar.

> [action]
> Now Ctrl-Drag from your `Note Display View Controller` to the `Vertical Space - Toolbar - Bottom Layout Guide` and select your `toolbarBottomSpace` outlet.
>
> ![image](connect_constraint.png)
>
> Great! The constraint is connected. If you run the app it will not do anything special just yet.  

Next, we need to ensure we are informed of the keyboard so when it pops up we can move the toolbar and when the keyboard disappears it will be returned to the bottom.

The **MakeSchool ConvenienceKit** helps us out here by wrapping things up a little bit so handling these notifications is super simple.  

##Keyboard Notifications

> [action]
> Add the following code into your `func viewWillAppear`:
>
    keyboardNotificationHandler = KeyboardNotificationHandler()
>        
        keyboardNotificationHandler!.keyboardWillBeHiddenHandler = { (height: CGFloat) in
            UIView.animateWithDuration(0.3) {
                self.toolbarBottomSpace.constant = 0
            }
        }
>        
        keyboardNotificationHandler!.keyboardWillBeShownHandler = { (height: CGFloat) in
            UIView.animateWithDuration(0.3) {
                self.toolbarBottomSpace.constant = -height
            }
        }
>
        
We assign the `KeyboardNotificationHandler` so we will be informed of keyboard notification events.  You can see how easily we can now modify the `toolbarBottomSpace` value depending
on the keyboard notification.  We use `-height` as we want to push the toolbar up from the bottom of the view.

Run your app, looking much nicer.

##The Trash Can

However, one last niggle: the trash can is still enabled when creating a new note. This doesn't make a whole lot of sense. Let's disable it.  

> [action]
> Add the following code to `func viewWillAppear`:
>
    if edit {
        deleteButton.enabled = false
    }
>

Great! However, how do we know when we are in edit mode?  In this case, we want to set `edit` to true when we are in the `New Note View Controller`.
Open this controller and look at the `prepareForSegue` function code. 
Notice that when we set the `NoteDisplayViewController` note, we can also set the edit variable. 

> [action]
> Add the following modifcation after the note is set.
>    
    noteViewController.edit = true
>

Now run the app...

What do we do when the user starts to gather a lot of notes, and instead of 5 entries they have 100 entries?

Good time to **Commit your code**.

Some search functionality in our dashboard would be nice.  Let's tackle that in the next chapter....
