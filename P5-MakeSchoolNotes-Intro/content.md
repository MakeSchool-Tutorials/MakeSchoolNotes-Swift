That time has come to make your first *real* app, your own version of the classic *Notes* app.  After finishing the *SimpleApp* tutorial you should have an understanding
of how to use Xcode and the fundamental building blocks of how an App is put together.  

In this tutorial we will build upon that knowledge to build a fully fledged application that will touch upon many beginner and intermediate development topics. 

We are going to be looking at the following topics:

- Introduction to Table Views
- The Navigation Controller
- Delegates, protocols and extensions
- Local storage and Realm
- Creating notes 
- Using Segues
- Capturing User Input
- Keyboard Handling
- Constraints
- Search Bar

Although we'll touch on some other topics, this is an outline of what youll be most familiar and comfortable with by the end of this tutorial.

Once you've finished, you'll have a good understanding of how to build a complete iOS utility app and be in good shape for the next tutorial, *Makestagram*!

#Getting Started

Although we could go through setting up the project step by step, I've decided to supply a project template that has all additional libraries, provides
starting point classes for us to quick start on the app development, and most importantly 'just works' for everyone.

Let's move onto the next chapter and start exploring a very important building block in many apps, Table Views.
